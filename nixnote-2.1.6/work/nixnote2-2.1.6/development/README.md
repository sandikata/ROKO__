# Development only helpers/shortcuts.

Note that those are only convenience shortcuts. They work for me on Ubuntu and may mail fail for some reason on
other distribution (e.g. Qt is installed on different way).

But in case those scripts doesn't work for you, either:
* do the trivial modification for your system
* or use qmake+make (see main [README.md](../README.md))
* or use docker build, which should work on all systems (as it internally uses Ubuntu).
