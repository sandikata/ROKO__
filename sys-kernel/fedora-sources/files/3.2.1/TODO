Config TODOs:
* At some point disable CONFIG_ISA everywhere. F17 ?


Spec file TODOs:

* modules-extra: Do a few more things to make it a bit more robust.
  - Allow for comments in the mod-extra.list file.
  - Don't fail the build if a module is listed but not built (maybe).
  - See if it can be tied into Kconfig instead of module names.

* investigate gzip modules. Everything should support this now?
  Looks like about 70M savings per kernel installed.
